## How AI Was Used

ChatGPT was used as a support tool to review layout structure and suggest improvements in CSS styling. It also helped clarify how to implement a simple JavaScript greeting feature.

All suggested code was reviewed, tested, and modified before being included in the final version.

It was also used to help debug image path issues and improve the responsiveness of the layout.

## Benefits

Using AI helped speed up development and provided quick clarification for technical concepts. It also helped identify layout issues and suggest improvements efficiently.

## Learning Outcomes

Through using AI as a support tool, I improved my understanding of HTML structure, CSS styling, and basic JavaScript functionality. 

I learned how to review AI-generated suggestions critically and adapt them to fit my project requirements instead of copying them directly.


## Responsible Use & Modifications

All AI suggestions were carefully reviewed and tested before being included in the project. I modified the structure, styling, and wording where necessary to match my own understanding and assignment requirements.

AI was used as a learning and support tool rather than as a replacement for my own work.
