## Project Overview

This project is a simple personal portfolio website developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

The website includes multiple sections such as About Me, Projects, and Contact, and it demonstrates basic front-end development concepts.

## Project Structure

The project follows a simple and organized folder structure:

- index.html → Main webpage structure
- css/styles.css → Styling and layout design
- js/script.js → JavaScript functionality (time-based greeting)
- assets/images/ → Contains images used in the website
- docs/ → Documentation files

## Design & Responsiveness

The layout is built using basic CSS styling. Sections are separated clearly with spacing and simple visual structure.

Responsive behavior is achieved using flexible widths and layout adjustments to ensure the website displays properly on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
